QR CODE PLACEHOLDER

This file is a placeholder for the QR code image that would be used in the secure backup page.

In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Generate a unique QR code for each user that contains:
   - A secure token for account linking
   - The API endpoint URL for the iOS app to connect to
   - Any additional parameters needed for secure authentication

2. The QR code should be regenerated periodically for security reasons

3. The iOS app would scan this QR code to establish a secure connection to the user's account

Please replace this text file with an actual QR code image named "qr-placeholder.png" when implementing the real system.
