## About Mary ðŸ’¼

My name is Mary Ruoro, CEO and Founder of an EdTech Company in Kenya.  
I am 28 years old. Our company has been wildly successful seeing as thereâ€™s a huge need to digitize school systems.  

We offer a cloud-based system that supports teachers, parents, and administrators with the tools and insights they need to help students reach their full potential â€” and we ensure safety is never an afterthought.
